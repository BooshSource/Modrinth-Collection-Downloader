# **Modrinth Collection Downloader**

Easily download your Private <b>Modrinth</b> Collections.<br/>

## **Reason this fork exists**
The original repo by Yasin had WAY too much information dumped on the README and the latest version did not work for me and i really did not feel like looking into what the problem was (BTW this is based on the version prior to his last update). I removed most of what i thought was unnecesary from here like the private key, CurseForge API, and left only what was needed for the config. 

Very good program though i just wanted to make this simpler for future me üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
